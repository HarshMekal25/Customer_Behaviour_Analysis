## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

* Imported dataset into Python using `pandas`
* Inspected structure (`df.info()`, `df.describe()`)

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Checked missing values, outliers, and data distributions
* Created visual summaries (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps)
* Identified top-performing products, peak months, and customer patterns

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
* Imputed missing values with median or mode
* Standardized categorical values and date formats
* Exported cleaned dataset for SQL & Power BI

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis

* Imported cleaned dataset into **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server**
* Executed analytical queries:

  * Total revenue, top regions, best-selling categories
  * Customer segmentation by frequency and spend
  * Time-based sales performance

### 5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

* Connected Power BI to the cleaned dataset
* Built an **interactive dashboard** with:

  * KPIs (Revenue, Profit Margin, Avg Order Value)
  * Sales trends by month, region, and product
  * Customer segmentation visuals
* Applied filters, slicers, and conditional formatting for insights

### 6️⃣ Report & Presentation

* Summarized insights in a structured report (PDF)
* Created a **Gamma presentation** highlighting process, findings, and recommendations
